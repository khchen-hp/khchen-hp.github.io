Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a PhD candidate in **IIP (Intelligent Transportation)** at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and my supervisor is [Prof. Hai Yang](https://cehyang.people.ust.hk/). 

I finished my Master study at **Sino-Danish College, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (SDC-UCAS)** in June 2021. As a joint programme, I was also awarded **Master of Science in Water and Environment** from **University of Copenhagen** in Dec. 2020. My supervisors are [Prof. Aijie Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wangaijie) (from HIT & CAS) and [Associate Prof. Luca Vezzaro](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/luca-vezzaro) (from DTU). My research project was **Optimal Control of Wastewater Treatment Plants towards Sustainability Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**. 

I graduated from **Chongqing University** in 2018 with Bachelor in Engineering, and my course was Civil Engineering, mainly about Municipal Engineering. From 2017-2018, I was a visiting student at **University College London** under the supervision of [Prof. Yun Bai](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-yun-bai). At the same time, I participated in a cooperative project with [Dr. Miao Guo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/miao.guo) from **Imperial College London**. The project was mainly about **Optimisation of Wastewater Treatment Strategies in Eco-Industrial Parks: Technology, location and transport**.
